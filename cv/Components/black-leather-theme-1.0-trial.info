To apply the\ntheme to views of a specific class, call `Apply` with the `Appearance`\nvalue for the class you\u0027d like to theme:\n\n```csharp\nBlackLeatherTheme.Apply (UIProgressView.Appearance);\n```\n\nTo apply the theme to specific view classes only when they are contained\nwithin other specific view classes, use `AppearanceWhenContainedIn`. In\nthe following example, we apply `BlackLeatherTheme` to `UIProgressView` only\nwhen `UIProgressView` is a child of `UINavigationBar`:\n\n```csharp\nBlackLeatherTheme.Apply (UIProgressView.AppearanceWhenContainedIn (typeof (UINavigationBar)));\n```\n\nFinally, to apply the theme to a specific view instance:\n\n```csharp\nUITableView tableView;\n...\n\nBlackLeatherTheme.Apply (tableView);\n```\n\nWhen applying a theme to a TableView, you still need to apply the theme to the cells.\n\nApplying the theme to specific view instances is especially useful for `UIButton`,\n`UILabel`, and `UIView`, since these classes are not themed automatically when\ncalling the parameterless version of `Apply`.\n\n## Options\n\nBlack Leather Theme supports options for the following classes:\n\n* `UIButton`: `\"confirm\"`, `\"cancel\"`\n","Hash":"583dc383af74318a13cbf3b648ababe9","TargetPlatforms":["ios"],"TrialHash":"f82dfcee7d7595d7c43c920706e0f11a"}
